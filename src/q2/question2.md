# [Question 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\ldots
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

The solution is fairly standard, though not the most memory-optimised. The general outline is this:

1. Iteratively generate terms of the Fibonacci sequence and store them in an array/list.
2. Filter out all that are even numbers.
3. Add all the even numbers together.
